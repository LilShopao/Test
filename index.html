    <p>Hi! This is Ij's little project! I'm glad you guys were able to find this! 
       If you may please help my make my parent's gift for them! I'm gonna make a whole
       collage of pictures and videos from this night for them, and make a video of my own
       So if you can, please do this for me: Use the camera app on your phone to take a  picture  
       with my parents or take a video and share something about them, wheather it is a story with them or 
       how you appreciate them. 
       Then, either click this 
       <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r9znWSLuc6vKxG-kw-YTghEnk5fFYvqs?usp=sharing">link</a>
       and upload the video/photo in here or click on the picture below. If you need help, find IJ. (Or anyone else en general that would 
       be able to help)
